    the past 3 years, TechMill has played the role as a catalyst for our evolving
    tech and startup community here in Denton. Throughout our time in Denton, we have
    organized a wide range of events and initiatives, but our goal was always to be
    iterative, learn from the community, and listen to feedback. After watching the
    community change and grow, and watching other organizations fill gaps where we
    couldn\u2019t, I feel like we have finally discovered our purpose.<\/p><p>When
    we started, TechMill focused on specifically supporting startups, as many of the
    founding board members were embedded in those communities. Since that founding,
    we have identified a growing need for practical tech education. This is very much
    a \"cart before the horse\" situation -- it\u2019s is very hard to find resources
    for new startups and convince other companies to make Denton their home if there
    is a lack of technical talent to support their needs.<\/p><p>We often hear<a id=\"footnote-1\"><\/a><sup>1<\/sup><span
    style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the <a id=\"footnote-2\"><\/a>lack of job opportunities<sup>2<\/sup><\/span><span
    style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for students who graduate from UNT, TWU, and NCTC.
    Then we experience a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of that talent to the surrounding
    DFW area (or out of state) where those opportunities are available. And while
    university computer science programs excel at providing a theoretical foundation
    in core computer science principles, new CS grads can find themselves overwhelmed
    with the ever-changing landscape of new frameworks, languages, and architectures
    in today''s technology workplace. \u00a0We have great relationships with professors
    and leaders at our local universities who understand this issue, and we are working
    with them to support their students who want to stay ahead of the technology curve.<\/span><\/p><p><span
    style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you will also notice is a growing population
    of technology professionals who do call Denton their home. In 2015, the US Dept
    of Labor &amp; Statistics reported that 24 percent of employed people did some
    or all of their work at home. In addition, the number of distributed companies
    is increasing, providing an advantage of hiring talent wherever it\u2019s located.<\/span><\/p><hr
    \/><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, TechMill is starting
    a new initiative: a part-time developer program called <a id=\"footnote-3\"><\/a>The
    Bolter<sup>3<\/sup><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Hosted at Stoke
    near downtown Denton, the program consists of short engagements--2 nights a week
    for 8 weeks. This program will support those looking for a career change, or students
    who want to supplement their academic experience with modern software development
    skills. Initially, we will start with an \u201cIntro to Web Development\u201d
    series consisting of learning HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This course is built
    upon an existing framework built by Epicodus that sets up course material, hands-on
    exercises, and homework. The program will last two months. The first month (section)
    teaches HTML, CSS, and Git while the second month introduces JavaScript and programming
    concepts. <\/span><\/p><p>If you''ve ever looked into attending a code camp, you
    probably noticed they''re in the realm of thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.\u00a0As
    this is an alpha program not just for TechMill, but anyone in town wanting to
    learn how to code, <strong>we''re running this course for free<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The
    only catch is, if you sign up for our first cohort, we need your feedback. This
    is a critical component in evaluating the course material, the speed at which
    the class is taught, and pain points for attendees that can be addressed in the
    future. After the initial class, we can recoup, evaluate, and eventually produce
    a polished code camp right here in Denton.<\/p>[caption id=\"attachment_1038\"

    then another, and now you\u2019re too busy with some other side project. Maybe
    you are taking those courses, but you\u2019re just not getting it, and while you
    post your questions in the comment sections, you\u2019re unable to get a straightforward
    answer on \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d something works. That\u2019s the
    gap we\u2019re attempting to fill.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TechMill
    has a bullpen of amazing, supportive, and talented developers and technical professionals
    who have been where you are, and now make a living doing what they love. Between
    our weekly in-person meetups and our community Slack group, you\u2019re never
    more than a few clicks away from connecting with someone. The classes are in person,
    led by experienced developers, where you have the opportunity to ask those fundamental
    questions to help you build a solid understanding of the covered topics. With
    this material, we\u2019re able to focus on content, comprehension, and repetition
    instead of administration and building curriculum.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:

    including some right here in DFW such as The Iron Yard, DevMountain, and many

    -- but we can show you an environment full of industry experience and a chance
    to take the reigns and pave your own way. For TechMill, this is an opportunity
    to make an impact in tech education by providing resources and building community
    by growing new developers, increasing the density of technical talent, thus enabling
    growth for tech-enabled businesses in Denton and encouraging businesses to relocate
    to Denton.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a new adventure
