<p>We've been humbled by the outpouring of love and support from our North Texas startup community.</p>
<p>Since we began this journey, we’ve promoted the philosophy of bootstrapping. <a href="http://igg.me/at/cowork-denton">Our IndieGoGo campaign</a> was our way of carefully measuring community need to better understand the type of co-working space Denton wants. While we are shy of our campaign’s funding goal, we’re forging a path forward using the bootstrap methodology we started with. Now that we have an accurate measurement of the community’s needs and appetite, we can build the co-working space you want!</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Friday, August 8th</a>, we will celebrate the grand opening of TechMill: Denton’s first co-working community, located right in the heart of the spot that made our very existence possible: <a href="http://dentonbanter.com/">Banter</a>!</p>
<p>TechMill will be a very unique kind of co-working space, offering shared working tables that are integrated directly into the community. These tables will be completely open for anyone to use for FREE.</p>
<p>We will also offer memberships with amenities at an extremely low cost: $50/month or $5/ day gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free coffee and tea</li>
<li>10% discount on food and espresso at Banter</li>
<li>Priority seating on shared tables</li>
<li>Access to a locking cabinet for storing equipment when out during the day</li>
</ul>
<p>Our tables will be located at the very front of Banter, and accommodate 6-8 people each. Each table will also have a power hub so no one has to go fishing for power! We have also helped Banter accommodate a larger network load by upgrading the WiFi network.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/196680522/">Come join us</a> at Banter Friday, August 8th, at 6:30 PM, check out Denton’s new co-working space, and share drinks with our founders and members! Let’s party!</p>
