<h3 dir="ltr">Denton's tech scene celebrating continued growth on August 18th at Harvest House.</h3>
<p>The city of Denton has seen a massive and energetic upshift in the last few years, and if you want to be a part of it, Bootstrap Denton is the place to be.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-3af884ec-c190-5dc3-258d-810f4498c6a5">"We held this event last year as a kick-off party for the launch of our non-profit, </span><a href="http://twitter.com/techmilldenton">TechMill</a>," says Kyle Taylor, "and we invited the whole city to join. It wasn’t just for us, we also wanted to showcase other organizations and tech initiatives in our community, so they could talk about what they're doing and how the people of Denton can get involved."</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-3af884ec-c190-5dc3-258d-810f4498c6a5">This year's event will gi</span>ve tech creatives, entrepreneurs, and early stage startups an opportunity to connect and learn about what's going on in everyone's favorite college town.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-3af884ec-c190-5dc3-258d-810f4498c6a5">Denton was named 6th on a list of top 25 U.S. counties for high-tech jobs (beating out Travis County) back in 2014. The continued support from the city of Denton for tech initiatives has made the community a stronger network for the entrepreneurs and tech creatives there. Last year, Denton City Council approved $220,000 to launch an economic development initiative now known as The Railyard.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-3af884ec-c190-5dc3-258d-810f4498c6a5">"We're really excited about this year's event,” says Taylor. “Harvest House is opening up their new food truck, Pan Ector will be live screen printing shirts, we’ll be hearing pitches from local startups, and the first round of drinks are on us thanks to generous sponsors. There are so many good reasons to come out and get to know the local tech scene!"</span></p>
