<p>We just had our awesome annual Bootstrap Denton party last week where we get the entire Denton tech / creative community together to showcase unique organizations in the area to talk about what they're working on and how we can get involved. This is great for our local community, but we're also part of a greater community - the entire North Texas region. With this, Denton is featured as one of the major regional communities in the area startup publication, <a href="http://launchdfw.com/">LaunchDFW</a>. Who has 2 thumbs and is our regional editor? This guy.</p>
<p>For those of you new or interested in the Denton startup/tech community, this post is going to highlight all the basics for you to get started. Luckily, we're pretty and keep things nice and short - so here we go.</p>
<h4>Meetups and Events</h4>
<p>We try and keep as many events as we can on our Meetup calendar you can find at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/startupdentontech">www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech</a>. Of course, this won't have everything (what do you think we are, mind readers?), but we'll have a lot. It's also a community calendar that we have other curators adding to, so here's the gist:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/224171621/">LittleD Open Coffee Club</a>, every other Tuesday morning, 8am at <a href="https://twitter.com/westoak_coffee">West Oak Coffee</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/StartupDentonTech/events/224030179/">APIs &amp; IPAs</a>, every other Tuesday (opposite of LittleDOCC), 6:30pm at <a href="https://twitter.com/HarvestHouseDTX">Harvest House</a>.</li>
<li>Arduino Meetup, once a month at The Forge located at North Branch Library</li>
<li><a href="http://nodeschool.io/denton-texas/">NodeSchool Denton</a>, once or twice a month on the weekends.</li>
<li>WomenWhoCode, a new meetup supporting female developers and entrepreneurs</li>
<li><a href="https://techmill.co.co/blog/2015-06-bootstrap-denton-workshop-series">Bootstrap Denton: Community Workshop Series</a>, once a month we hold a 2-hour workshop on a topic that benefits local freelancers, entrepreneurs, and students. Topics cover sales, marketing / social media, tech (web/mobile development), design, and anything else in that realm.</li>
<li>BootConf, a one-day conference focused on the lean startup methodology and teaching others how to bootstrap their own business.</li>
<li><a href="http://dentonmakerfaire.com/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://dentonmakerfaire.com/">Denton Mini Maker Faire</a>, a family friendly event promoting makers and educating kids about technology.</li>

<h4 class="graf--h4">Organizations to get involved with</h4>

<h4>Exciting Startups and Companies</h4>

<h4>What You Can Expect From The Scene</h4>
<p>Well now, that's a loaded statement if I've ever seen one. You can expect community love like you've never experience before. We cherish our relationships in the community and thrive on building density. I'm not sure if you ever witnessed it, but Dentonites are very passionate about their community and make sure you feel included, and you can expect this from any meetup we run or event we hold. It's not about us, it's about you. We're here to help you grow as entrepreneurs, startups, freelancers, students, etc - it doesn't matter, if you want to learn and grow, dive into the community and have a drink with us (coffee is incredibly prevalent in this town).</p>
<p>As always, feel free to reach out to me personally if you have any questions or need any help - that's why we're here.</p>
