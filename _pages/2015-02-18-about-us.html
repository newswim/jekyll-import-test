<h1 class="special-heading">WELCOME TO TECHMILL</h1>
<h2 class="special-heading">About Us</h2>
<p>TechMill was formed in 2014 by individuals working independently to improve and grow the local technology and startup community in Denton. Our group ranged from Silicon Valley veterans, seasoned entrepreneurs, startup community organizers, and university students.</p>
<p>By going together, we're able to go farther and push boundries that no other group has done before in Denton. At the core of our organization lies a "give first" mentality that puts community ahead all else. We support the local entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small businesses through educational workshops, networking events, and creative mixers to bring the tech and startup community together as one.</p>
<h2 class="special-heading">Our Team</h2>
<p> Below you can read a little more about each of our team members and what they do in the local tech and startup community.<br />
