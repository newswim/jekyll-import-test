    class=\"p1\">Before TechMill even started, most of us had been organizing events
    independently from each other for some time. We weren\u2019t organizing them because
    we were trying to turn a profit or make a sale - we were organizing them because
    we wanted to find other people just like us. People who were working to start
    their own company, build their next cool project, or just find someone to sit
    down, order a drink, and have a conversation with. That\u2019s really the core
    of what events are for TechMill - a way to find your stride.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">The
    best lesson we\u2019ve learned from running events so far is: be consistent. While
    it\u2019s easy to run a one-off event on a random weekday night, we also know
    that not everyone checks the calendar regularly. We wanted to create a few consistent,
    casual meetups that you can never miss and always find someone there to chat with.
    Interested in what\u2019s new going on in the tech scene? Join us at LittleDOCC.
    Did Monday suck? Join us for a drink at APIs &amp; IPAs. Now while those are the
    two regular events, there are countless side projects and extended meetings and
    dinners that will come out of those based on conversations you\u2019ll have -
    we guarantee it.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">In addition to our regular events, we work
    on a number of other events throughout the year to bring people together, educate
    the community, and collectively push our community forward. Events like our TechMill
    Workshop Series, a one-day conference like Bootstrap Denton, a mind-blowing and
    fun Startup Weekend Denton, and even our annual creative mixer, Bootstrap Denton.<\/p><p
