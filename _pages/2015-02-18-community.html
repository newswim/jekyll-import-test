<p class="p1">TechMill - Community</p>
<p class="p1">Without community, TechMill would not exist - but then again, “you” are the one thing we’re good at. Without you, there is no TechMill, there are no meetups, there is no community.</p>
<p class="p1">There are two rules we instill in our members and all events that we do, and they’re very, very simple.</p>
<h3>1. Show up.</h3>
<p>We get this question a lot, “How can I get involved in the community?” While we do have a lot of things going on ranging from our regular events, workshops, partnering with other organizations - the first step to getting involved is honestly just showing up. There is no community without people, and being there is the first step in supporting the community.</p>
<h3>2. Give First.</h3>
<p>Great communities are not built on greed, narcissism, or hate. They’re built on camaraderie, support, and high fives. When you join our community, head to a meetup, and strike up a conversation with someone about their current projects or goals, we encourage you to ask, “How can I help?”</p>
