  _field_3: "Re: Website Issues...?\n\nHi\n\nHope your business is doing great this
    year.\n \nI was doing some industry benchmarking for a client of mine when I came
    across your website.\n\nI noticed a few technical errors which correspond with
    a drop of website traffic over the last 6-8 months which I thought I would bring
    to your attention.\n\nI was analyzing your site and it seems that some of your
    website rankings have dropped. It is due to non optimized techniques/errors And
    Google guidelines not being followed properly. \n \n•    Your web page failed
    on 4 high priority checks: Meta Description, <h1> Headings Status, Broken Links
    Test, URL Canonicalization Test\n•    Your most common keywords are not appearing
    in one or more of the meta-tags above. Your primary keywords should appear in
    your Meta.\n•    Site link diversity and Domain Authority is low\n•    URL Canonicalization
    should resolve to the same URL, but currently do not. \n•    5 of them are missing
    the required 'alt' attribute.\n•    Your website should load quicker \n•    Your
    webpage has so many 'img' tags and 5 of them are missing the required 'alt' attribute.
    \n•   Your page has more than 20 http requests, which can slow down page loading.\n
    \nI would love the chance to help as well however; this report will at least give
    you a gauge on the quality of what I do.  If you are interested then please share
    your requirement and contact details.\n\nPlease let me know if we can discuss
    this.\n\nThanks\nLisa Scott\nlisadigitalmarketing@gmail.com "
