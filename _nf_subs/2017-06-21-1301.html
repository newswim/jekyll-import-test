    connecting disconnected youth and other low-wage workers and young adults, ages
    17-29, with IT and Advanced Manufacturing Careers.  Many in this target population
    are facing barriers to employment.  The TechHire grant offers participants tuition
    support and paid internships through programs at  North Central. Texas College.
    NCTC is the community college serving Denton County. \n\nPrograms included in
    the grant: \n\n Computer Information Systems                                                             Electrical\nCyber
