  _field_3: "To Whom This May Concern: \n\n     My name is Jason Martin and I am a
    Texas Native. Currently, I am a radio producer/production director for four radio
    stations in Miami, FL and have been in radio since 2002.\n\nFor a year and a half,
    I’ve been developing an internet radio station that is music driven, will compete
    with local AM/FM stations by paying local artist to play their music, and will
    inform, entertain, and discuss what affects the DFW area and surrounding cities.
    But instead of having on-air personalities who are on daily, at a set time, I
    am reaching out to specific podcast shows/sites who are based in Texas or the
    DFW area. Podcasts that have specific focuses such as, fashion, politics, finance,
    entertainment, tech, etc. This is how I came across your podcast.\n\nI would like
    to discuss possible cross promotions using content from TechMill that will stream
    on my internet radio station while promoting TechMill  and other podcasters who
    contribute exclusive content for the station and station site. \n\nIf this is
    a viable promotion, and TechMill would like to discuss further,  please don’t
    hesitate to email me with any questions and/or set up a phone call or face time
    session. Again, thank you for your time. \n\nRegards, \n\n    Jason Martin \n\n
    \n\n\n"
